# CockBot
A Discord bot I made for my personal Discord server

This bot contains a variety of features tailored to the needs of my group of friends in the server.

Those features include:
  - A system for sharing "silver" in the game Albion Online between all party members that contributed to our play session
  - Some features to aid our D&D sessions such as web scraping information from a wiki page directly to discord chat
  - Role Reactions
  - A scuffed music bot

Obviously the bot token, mongoDB server adress, and the discord IDs have been removed from the code

(The name is referring to the animal and is an inside joke)
